			<h2>Yongmeori Coast is rocky coastline where Mt Sanbangsan stretches into the ocean. It has features with unique cliff formations which turns the coast into a stunning walk.</h2>
			<h2>The Yongmeori Coast got its name because the beach looks like a dragon that is jumping into the ocean with its head raised (“Yong” means dragon and “Meori” means head in Korean). Yongmeori is a sandstone bed created by layers of sand that have been deposited for tens of millions of years.</h2>

This monument was established by the Embassy of the Netherlands and the Korean Foundation on April 1st, 1980 to strengthen the diplomatic ties between Korean and the Netherlands, as well as to commemorate the dedication and hard work of Hendrick Hamel.</h2>
